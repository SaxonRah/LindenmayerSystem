# LindenmayerSystem
	A simple C++ plugin for Unreal Engine 4 containing everything needed to play with Lindenmayer Systems.
	Plugin was built and tested with 4.14.3

# About
	This plugin contains an LSystem component which has all the functionality of a standard lsystem.
	It also contains a Turtle component which can parse a lsystem, and can draw, generate splines, 
	or do anything you wish. The LSystem Actor is the main class that implements everything.

# Things to Add
	Measure performance of LSystem struct. Maybe look at by ref and const correctness
	Expand Turtle example functions to control debug output
	Create Turtle functions to make Spline Mesh - Done
	Implement the procedural mesh component and do 100% procedural l system gen

# Bugs
	Generation of splines need to be made so that it can exist forever connected in construction script.

# Blueprint Usage
	Install plugin to game directory or engine directory.
	Create blueprint actor based on LMSystem Actor.
	Refer to the picture in the root.
	Then place the blueprint actor in the world and run.
	
	If using video tutorial or want this, Here are the 3D Tree Rules
	3D Tree Example Rules
	Generations :	3
	Axiom :			"1"
	Rules :			"1" -> "D-D+D+D[<+^2]-DD-D[<^-2]<^2"
					"2" -> "D+D-DD>L>>L[<+1]-DDD>L>>L>L[<-1]<1"
	
# C++ Usage
## LSystem Setup and Grow
		// Setup
		FLSInfo KochCurveInfo;
		KochCurveInfo.Generations = 4;
		KochCurveInfo.Axiom = TEXT("D");
		KochCurveInfo.AddRule(TEXT("D"), TEXT("D+D−D−D+D"));
		
		LSysComponent->SetupLSystem(KochCurveInfo);
		
		// Will grow by KochCurveInfo.Generations
		LSysComponent->GrowLSystem();
		// Will grow by given generation parameter
		LSysComponent->GrowLSystemBy(6);
	
## Render LSystem Setup and Rendering
		// We use an array of rules to give users the ability to have multiple commands per variable.
		TArray<ERLSRenderRuleType> RenderRuleTypeArray; RenderRuleTypeArray.Empty();

		RenderRuleTypeArray.Add(ERLSRenderRuleType::LSRR_Draw);
		FRLSRenderRule DRule = FRLSRenderRule(TEXT("D"), RenderRuleTypeArray, 0.0f, 35.0f);
		RenderRuleTypeArray.Empty();

		RenderRuleTypeArray.Add(ERLSRenderRuleType::LSRR_TurnRight);
		FRLSRenderRule TRRule = FRLSRenderRule(TEXT("+"), RenderRuleTypeArray, 90.0f, 0.0f);
		RenderRuleTypeArray.Empty();

		RenderRuleTypeArray.Add(ERLSRenderRuleType::LSRR_TurnLeft);
		FRLSRenderRule TLRule = FRLSRenderRule(TEXT("-"), RenderRuleTypeArray, 90.0f, 0.0f);
		RenderRuleTypeArray.Empty();

		FRLSRenderInfo Info;
		Info.Rules.Add(DRule);
		Info.Rules.Add(TRRule);
		Info.Rules.Add(TLRule);
		
		LSystemRenderInfo = Info;
		
		// Render LSystem
		RenderLSystem(LSystem, LSystemRenderInfo);
		

# C++ Heierarchy
## LSystemComponent . h/cpp
	The component where all the string rewriting happens. Has several example l systems.
		FLSRule			- UStruct
			Rule for a letter
		FLSInfo			- UStruct
			Information about the LSystem
				Generations	- Int32
					Times to iterate.
				Axiom 		- FString
					Starting string.
				Rules		- TArray of FLSRules
					Collection of Rules.
				States		- TArray of FStrings
					History of LSystem Generations
		FLSystem		- UStruct
			The LSystem itself.
				FLSInfo		- UStruct
					Information about the LSystem
		
## TurtleComponent . h/cpp
	TurtleComponent is a USceneComponent based component, which parses a string and issues commands based on rules
		TArray<FRLSTInfo> State;
		FRLSRenderInfo LSystemRenderInfo;
		RLSTInfo TurtleInfo;
		
		// Turtle Commands
			FTransform Move(float length);
			Draw(float length);
			DrawLeaf(float angle, float length);
			TurnRight(float angle);
			TurnLeft(float angle);
			Turn180();
			PitchUp(float angle);
			PitchDown(float angle);
			RollRight(float angle);
			RollLeft(float angle);
			Save();
			Restore();
			
## ALMSystem.h/cpp
		ALMSystem is a LSystem Actor that has a pet turtle component which has magical drawing powers.
		It also has the LSystemComponent for the functionality.
		It procedurally generates splines to draw the lsystem.
			
		
## RenderLSystem.h
		RenderLSystem is contains structures to help rendering.
			FRLSTInfo		- UStruct
				Information about the turtle's transform and drawing commands
			ERLSRenderRuleType	- Enum
				Contains all the different turtle commands.
			FRLSRenderRule 		- UStruct
				Variable and an array of associated turtle commands.
			FRLSRenderInfo 		- TArray of FRLSRenderRules
				Information for the rendering.
